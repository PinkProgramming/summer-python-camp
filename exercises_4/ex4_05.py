"""
Write a function that takes an int and returns different messages saying in what range the int is in. For example: the function takes 5 and returns "Your int is in range 0-10", or if the function takes 11 it could return "Your int is in range 11-20". Return at least 3 different messages.

HINT

	if 1 in range(0, 2):
    print("1 is in range 0-2")
 What happens if you change 1 to 3?

HINT
